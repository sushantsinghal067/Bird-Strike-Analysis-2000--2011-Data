Overview
The Bird Strike Analysis Dashboard project aims to create an interactive and comprehensive dashboard to analyze bird strike incidents from 2000 to 2011. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the understanding of bird strike patterns, provide insightful visualizations, and enable data-driven decision-making for aviation safety stakeholders.

Key Features and Functionalities

Charts: Users can interact with various charts to visualize bird strike data dynamically.
Filters and Drill-Down Capabilities: Apply filters to view specific data segments and drill down into detailed views.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze bird strike trends over different time periods.
Incident Location Mapping: Visualize bird strike incidents on geographical maps to identify hotspot areas.
Real-Time Data Updates: The dashboard is updated in real-time to reflect the latest data updates.

Technologies and Tools Used

Power BI: Used for creating the dashboard and visualizations.
SQL: Employed for data extraction from databases.
Python: Utilized for data manipulation and cleaning processes.
Integration: Data flows seamlessly from SQL databases into Power BI, with Python scripts automating data cleaning and transformation.

Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

Data Quality Issues: Implemented custom data cleaning scripts in Python to ensure data accuracy.
Performance Optimization: Optimized SQL queries to enhance the performance of data retrieval and dashboard responsiveness.
Geospatial Analysis: Overcame challenges in mapping bird strike incidents by integrating geospatial data visualization techniques.

Outcomes and Results
